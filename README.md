# The Job Hackers calendar bot

The Job Hackers have both an events channel in their Slack as well as a calendar hosted on Google. It is the intension of the bot to watch the Slack events channel and mirror authorized events in the calendar.

### potential technologies

* Slack Ruby Client -- A Ruby client for the Slack Web, RealTime Messaging and **Events** APIs. Comes with a handy command-line client, too. If you are not familiar with these concepts, you might want to watch this video. < https://github.com/slack-ruby/slack-ruby-client >



* Simple REST client for version V3 of the Calendar API < https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-ruby-client/blob/main/generated/google-apis-calendar_v3/OVERVIEW.md >


##### other curiosities
*  slack-smart-bot -- slack-smart-bot can create bots on demand, create shortcuts, run ruby code... just on a chat channel, you can access it just from your mobile phone if you want and run those tests you forgot to run, get the results, restart a server... no limits. < https://github.com/MarioRuiz/slack-smart-bot >
